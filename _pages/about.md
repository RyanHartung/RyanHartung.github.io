I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department. My research focuses on high-performance computing and distributive systems. I am currently working under the guidance of [Dr. Douglas Thain](https://cse.nd.edu/faculty/douglas-thain/){:target="_blank"}, and I am a part of the RADICAL team working on the [xGFabric Project](https://sites.google.com/view/xgfabric){:target="_blank"}.
