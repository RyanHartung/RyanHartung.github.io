I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Notre Dame in the Computer Science and Engineering department, where my research focuses on high performance computing and distributive systems. I am currently working under the guidance of [Dr. Douglas Thain](https://cse.nd.edu/faculty/douglas-thain/).
